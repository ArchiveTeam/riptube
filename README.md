# RipTube

This is a script for archiving YouTube accounts.

## Why

YouTube videos tend to disappear for pretty much no reason. Whether because
of an invalid copyright claim, YouTube finding a video too weird, videos
being removed by the original user for stupid reasons, or something else,
videos just go away. This is a mechanism for resisting that.

## How

python3 riptube.py &lt;username&gt;

Other options are likely to come.
